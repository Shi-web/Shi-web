### 🎓 Computer Science @ University of Texas at Arlington | 👩‍💻 Aspiring Software & AI Engineer, Cybersecurity Enthusiast | 🌟 Lifelong Learner

I'm a senior majoring in Computer Science with a strong foundation in software engineering principles and a growing passion for AI/ML and data-driven problem solving. I enjoy building applications that are both functional and meaningful, from astrology-based social apps to student success platforms.

I'm especially interested in using technology to empower people and simplify everyday tasks. I bring a collaborative mindset from my work as a Learning Specialist, and I'm always exploring new tools and frameworks to sharpen my skills.
